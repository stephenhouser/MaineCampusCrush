Things to clean up.

Client:

- Make some indication of what team you are playing for
    Somewhere while playing, on game over dialog, or on the leaderboard.

- How to detect "cascades" when dropping and filling trigger other indirect matches.

- How to score "cascades"

- Sound active after switching away -- iOS only? -- Shows on lock screen

- 2/2/2015 had an erroneous entry in the Leaderboard -- Team="" in row 11
	some sort of unassociated entry at 16:34 or so. Deleted, wait to happen again/

- Fix max size of tiles -- looks really screwy when it gets large.
	Maybe at iPad size?
